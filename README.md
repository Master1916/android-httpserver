Android HTTP Server
====================

Overview
--------
HTTP server that can run on an Android device and serve external content. 

This was written specifically for serving image and video files from an Android device on a local network, but could easily be adapted for other stuff. 

At the time it was written I looked at many small Java HTTP servers but none quite fit the bill, either due to size and dependencies, or just craziness with usage, or bugs/errors on Android, hence the existence of this. 

TODO

Needs tests committed, documentation, etc.
